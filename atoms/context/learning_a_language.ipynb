    "\n",
    "**_The single most important thing that you can learn is how to frame your problem in a way that you can communicate to a computer._** Crucially, the real power of the computer isn't figuring out how to tell it to add `1, 2, 3, 4` together and calculate the mean (average), it's figuring out how to tell it to add _any possible set of numbers_ together and work out the mean. It's when you start to see ways to do this for sets of _hard_ problems (for you) that you know you've started to understand the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "So these notebooks are intended to help you start learning a new language -- a programming language -- but you should always remember this: you're not stupid if you don't know how to explain things to the computer so that it can help you find the answer. You're learning the basics of how to communicate with computers; there are only two things that _are_ silly: the first is expecting to be able to run before you can walk; the second is copying and pasting answers without trying to understand _why_ they are answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, there is a third silly thing: not asking for help. In the same way that learning a new human language is easier if you immerse yourself in the culture and make friends with some native speakers, learning a new computer lanugage is easier if you immerse yourself in the culture of computing and make friends with some more proficient speakers. But just as your French- or Chinese-speaking friends will get tried of answering your questions if you don't make it obvious that you're working _hard_ to learn, most programmers won't be very impressed if you just ask for 'the answer' and then come back two days later with the _same question_."

It's the same for programming: the reason you got a 'silly' answer is that we haven't taught you how to ask the right question yet! For a language like Python \"`4`\" is not always the same as \"`4.0`\"... and sometimes the way ahead is unclear, but don't worry if you can't get the right answer _yet_, how to 'talk numbers' is the main topic in the _next_ notebook and we'll show you the answer at the end of this notebook.\n",

And that's only because we have had a lot more practice in the language of programming.

Depending on the question we might: give you the answer and explain why it's the answer; give you a really annoying _partial_ answer because it's something that we want you to figure out for yourself; or say \"That's a really tough question, we'll have to look up the answer\".
