    "## Why _you_ should learn to program\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many good reasons for geographers to learn to code, but let's start with some good _general_ reasons why _you_ should learn to program a computer even if you never use it to make a map or complete a bit of spatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Why You Should Learn How to Code](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UD2xoiCGTDo/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UD2xoiCGTDo)\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is a useful perspective on whether or not learning to code is hard:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you don't have a reason for learning to code outside of trying making lots of money that's not a very long term passion... but when you have an idea or a problem that you're passionate about solving then that's why we keep on going... but do you need to have an understanding of complex math or logic skills, the answer is no.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Is Learning to Code Hard](http://img.youtube.com/vi/k7Txbdvzx90/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/k7Txbdvzx90)\n",
    "\n",
    "So while 'making money' is (often) a nice outcome of learning to code, having a passion for what you want to _do_ with your code is what's going to get you through the worst parts of the learning curve. You also need to be realistic: to become a professional programmer is something that happens over many years, you probably won't just take a couple of classes and then go out into the world saying \"I'm a programmer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And, no, you do _not_ need to know advanced maths in order to learn how to code: you need to be able to think logically and to reframe your problems in ways that align _with_ the computer."

    "## The Benefits of Coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a practical context we think that the benefits of learning to code fall into three categories:\n",
    "1. **Flexibility**: a computer can often apply the _same_ analytical process to a completely different data set (_e.g._ rainfall in UK vs rainfall in the US) with minimal effort compared to trying to do each step manually in, say, Excel or SPSS. For students it comes down to this: if you discover a newer, better data set half way through your dissertation and want to use this for your analysis instead of the old, inaccurate data, it's a lot easier and faster to update your analyses if you have used code to do the analysis to-date!\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility**: recently, it's been discovered that a lot of research cannot be reproduced. In other words, if one scientist tries to duplicate what someone else did in order to check something out (as is important in the scientific method) they're finding that the results don't line up. So a second example of why coding your data analysis for a dissertation: you've just finished your analysis when someone points out that you made a mistake with the data right back at the beginning; redoing all of that in Excel or SPSS would be a nightmare, but with code it can be as easy as changing one line and hitting 'Run'!\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: a computer doesn't care if you throw 10 lines or 10 billion lines at it, the only thing that changes is how long it takes to get an answer. In other words, if your code 'works' on a subset of your data it should also work on your entire data set no matter how big it is. This is also a good way to develop code: rather than try to read in the whole data set in one go while you're still trying to understand it, take a few rows and make sure you're handling _those_ ones correctly (and if what you see squares with what you were told) before expanding to larger and larger subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the payoff for coding the answer to a problem instead of just clicking through the options in SPSS or Arc can seem a long way away. It's like learning a new language: you spend a lot of time asking directions to the train station or whether someone had a nice breakfast before you can start work on the novel or the business case. But the payoff _is_ there if you stick with it!"

    "## The 3 virtues of a programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful idea comes from [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) (the man with the strong 'tache game below!), who created a programming language called Perl. Larry said that programmers had three virtues: **Laziness, Hubris, and Impatience**. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://cdn.quotationof.com/images/larry-wall-1.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons that these are virtues in programming (but not in your studies!) are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Laziness** makes you want to put in the effort _now_ to reduce the amount of effort you'll have to put in _later_. It might be a lot of work to produce a map of _one_ US State automatically using code, but once you've worked out how to do it for one state, then you've also figured out how to do it for _all 50_! That is useful laziness.\n",
    "2. **Hubris** makes you want to write code that other people won't want to \"say bad things about\". Over time you'll come to understand more intuitively what makes 'good' code in more detail (and we cover it a bit in the last notebook), but the short version is: it's efficient, it's easy to read, and it's clever.\n",
    "3. **Impatience** is about wanting the answer _now_ and looking for ways to get _there_ as quickly as possible. Being impatient doesn't mean just jumping into writing code, it actually means that you _first_ look too see whether and how other people have solved similar problems before starting work on your own code. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we try to stand on the shoulder of giants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hint_**: you'll see a lot of laziness when you start trying to write code. Programmers don't like writing **`remove`** when they could just write **`rm`**, nor do they like writing **`define`** when they could just write **`def`**. Keep an eye out for these mnemonics as they can be pretty daunting at first."

    "### The 3 false virtues\n",
    "\n",
    "Larry also pointed out that these virtues had three mirror-image false virtues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **False laziness** happens when you leave something working but half-finished and, most likely, about to break. When you start using [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) you may find that it makes it easy to copy+paste answers into your notebook and then you can glue it together messily. This isn't the same as _understanding_ and _adapting_ the solution that you found online to _your_ problem, so it's false laziness. To really develop a learning mindset, [don't copy+paste code, type it out](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-benefits-of-typing-instead-of-copying-54ed734ad849#.es5mw1j0z). \n",
    "2. **False hubris** is thinking that no one else's code is 'good enough' for you. Sometimes copy+paste is false laziness, but refusing to recognise when copy+paste (or importing a library, more on this later) _is_ the right thing to do is false hubris.\n",
    "3. **False impatience** is getting started on coding your answer to a problem when you don't yet understand what the problem actually _is_. One thing that a lot of programmers do is half-listen to what someone has asked them to do and then go haring off without sitting down to make any kind of plan. It's like writing an essay without having done the readings. Nudge, nudge.\n",
