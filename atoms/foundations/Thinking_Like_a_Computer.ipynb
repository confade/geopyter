    "If you've never really got to grips with what is happening inside a computer, then this TedED video would be a good way to get started because it helps to explain the basics of things like I/O and what actually happens when you click with the mouse on a button. In fact, you will see that we've used code to import the YouTube video in a way that requires me to do very little work and this is one of the strengths of programming: that someone else created the code to embed a YouTube video into an iPython notebooks (which is what this web page is) and all I need to do is know how to ask that code to find the video on the YouTube web site. Everything else happens automatically."

If not, well Google and YouTube are your friends: we won't pretend to have all the answers and you might find by searching something that is right on your level.

    "The really important thing to get from this last video is that computers are chaining together long sets of simple operations which always basically work out to 1 or 0, which is the same as True or False. This is [Boolean logic](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/boolean.htm) and we're going to be doing a lot more with it later in this set of sessions, but you should always keep in mind that a huge set of calculations are going on in your computer in an order specified by a set of _rules_: do 'A', then do 'B', then... When these rules become sufficiently complex they are called algorithms. And when they get so complicated that they are not easy to write down as a set of logical outputs, it's often easier to express in a more human-readable form... which is why we have [programming languages](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/proglang.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember: finding the average of a set of numbers involves an algorithm (which in-turn in a digital comupter is based on lots of logical operations involving 1s and 0s). And calculating the probability that the lecturer won't show up to the first lecture also involves an algorithm, it's just that it's a much more complicated one unless you take matters into your own hands and arrange for an accident..."

    "What are computers good at?\n",

    "There is a long-standing contest, called the Turing Test in honour of [the famous computer pioneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), that demonstrates this difference rather nicely: a computer passes the Turing test if it can fool a person into thinking that they're talking to another person. Some people have claimed that if a computer can _really_ pass the Turing Test by keeping up a conversation of indefinite length on any range of topics then we'll have to declare that machines have become full AIs (Artificial Intelligences). To put it another way: if it sounds like a human and responds like a human... then is it a human?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps fortunately for us, althoug computers are getting a lot better at holding up their end of the conversation they still seem to have a hard time fooling anyone for very long. In contrast, bigger and better computers have now beat the best humans at Chess and Go, and are being used to help us understand earthquakes and climate change on a huge scale. Here, computers can do billions -- or trillions -- of calculations a second to work out that if 'A' happens then 'B' is the next most likely thing to happen, and so on and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that games like Go and Chess have well-understood rules as (ultimately) do natural processes like climate change and earthquakes. Chess is 'easier' for a computer than Go because a big enough computer can work out every possible chess move and pick the best one, whereas it can't do that for Go and so has to make 'choices' based on incomplete information. Earthquakes may have even more 'rules', but as far we know they still follow _some_ set of rules dictated by physics, chemistry, and chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "People, however, don't use the same unchanging rules in conversation. Yes, conversations have norms, unless you're using an online comment forum where it's normal to start a conversation by asking someone if they're an idiot, but people don't just 'play games' within the rules, they actually play with the rules themselves in a way that computers find very, very hard to follow. Think of sarcasm: you say one thing but mean exactly the opposite; and your delivery is sufficiently deadpan then sometimes even real people have trouble knowing if you're being sincere!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why AI of the sort you might have seen in _2001_ or _Blade Runner_ has been twenty years away for the last sixty years! Recently, computers have been getting better and better at doing really difficult things, but it's usually still in a narrow area where we understand the rules and we normally need to spend a _lot_ of time training the computer. \n",
