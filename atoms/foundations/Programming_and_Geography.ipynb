    "## The Rise (Again) of Computational Geography\n",
    "\n",
    "We live in a world transformed by big (geo)data: from Facebook likes and satellites, to travel cards and drones, the process of collecting and analysing data about the world around us is becoming very, very cheap. Twenty years ago, gathering data about the human and physical environment was expensive, but now a lot of it is generated as the ‘exhaust’ of day-to-day activity: tapping on to the bus or train, taking photos (whether from a satellite, drone, or disposable camera), making phone calls, using our credit cards, and surfing the web. And that's before you start looking at the Terabytes of data being generated by satellites, air quality and river flow sensors, and other Earth Observation Systems! \n",
    "\n",
    "As the costs of capturing, curating, and processing these data sets falls, the discipline of geography is changing. You face a world in which many of the defining career options for geographers with basic quantitative skills will either no longer exist, or will have been seriously de-skilled. So much can now be done through a web browser (e.g. [CartoDB](https://carto.com) that specifying ‘Knowledge of ArcGIS’ is becoming superfluous; not because geo-analysis jobs are no longer in demand or no longer done -- in fact, they are more vital than ever -- but because the market for these skills has split in two: expensive, specialist software is being superseded by simple, non-specialist web-based tools on the ‘basic’ side, and by customised code on the ‘advanced’ side. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What's the Difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not Just Quantitative Geography\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational approaches -- which is to say, approaches to geography using code -- differ in important ways from the quantitative skills commonly taught in ‘methods’ classes: computational geography is underpinned by algorithms that employ concepts such as _iteration_ and _recursion_, and we use these to tackle everything from a data processing problem to an entire research question. For example, Alex Singleton’s OpenAtlas (available for free from the [Consumer Data Research Centre](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/product/cdrc-2011-census-open-atlas)) contains 134,567 maps. Alex designed and wrote a script to _iterate_ over the Census areas (i.e. to ‘visit’ each area in turn when creating a map), and to _recurse_ into smaller sub-regions from larger regions (i.e. to keep drilling down into smaller and smaller geographies) in order to generate maps at, literally, every conceivable scale. Then he let the computer do the ‘boring bit’ of actually creating each and every map. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Thinking Algorithmically\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking _algorithmically_ requires students – and professionals – to deal with abstraction: we don’t want to define how each analysis should work, or how each map should look; rather, we want to specify a set of rules about how to select and display data on a map, and then let the computer make them all for us. In this way of working it’s not really any more work to create 500 maps than it is to create 5 because we’ve been able to tell the computer how to make maps in a way that it can ‘understand’ or, more accurately, apply. But learning to think this way is _hard work_: I usually don't actually know exactly what my maps are going to look like until _after_ I've made them. Often, I'll find that the first time around they don't show quite what I want, or that what I thought would be interesting, wasn't. But the difference from the 'normal' way of working is that I make a few tweaks to my code and then just run the code again. And again... as many times as I need to in order to get what I want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Open Source Ethos\n",
    "\n",
    "And then I can take that code and apply it to a new problem. Or a new case study. I can post it online and let others build off of my work. Giving away my code might seem like a bad idea, but think about this: in a world of exciting research questions, are you going to be able to tackle every one? And your own work _already_ builds off of code that other people gave away... perhaps you should give back to the community? Not just because it's a good thing to do, but because people will learn who you are. They might be in a position to offer you a job, or they might approach you as a collaborator, or they might point someone else with an interesting opportunity in your direction because you have built a reputation as a contributor."
