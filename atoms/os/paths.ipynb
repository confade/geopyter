    "When you use an app on your mobile phone or on your computer it will often save your files somewhere convenient so that you can find them again, but this isn't magic: a programmer made a choice about how to do this for you, and now that you're learning to program _you_ have to make that choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "So at _some_ point you will need to learn how to read/write data from elsewhere on the computer or the Internet. At that point, for anyone who learned to use a computer after about 1992, computers can seem very unfriendly indeed! That's because when you are programming you will need to give the computer a lot more information about how to find, read, and write data. "

    "1. Directories (a.k.a. folders) and files all have a unique location _somewhere_ on your hard drive.\n",

    "- `/` is the **root directory** (so `cd /` would take you to the 'root' of the hard drive)\n",
    "- `~` is the **home directory** (this is a shortcut: it's the same as typing `cd /Users/myusername/`)\n",
    "- `.` means the **current directory** (this is avoid ambiguity: `cd ./myusername/Documents` would assume that in the current directory there is a sub-directory called `Documents` under `myusername`)\n",
    "- `..` means the **next directory up** (this is so that you don't have to type out `cd /Users/myusername/Settings` just to go from `Documents` 'over' to `Settings`; instead, you can use `cd ../Settings/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of terminology: any path that starts with a `/` is an _**absolute path**_ because we are starting from the _**root**_ directory; any path that starts with either `..` or `.` is a _**relative path**_ because it is starting from the _**current**_ directory and is relative to where the Terminal or program 'is' now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows vs Everyone Else\n",
    "\n",
    "For historical reasons, Windows has long been just a bit different from Unix/Linux/Mac in how paths are specified: on Windows it has long been the case that the path separator was `\\`, not `/` (`:` also isn't allowed in file name on a Mac for historical reasons)!\n",

    "\n",
    "If you remember that on a Unix/Mac we use `\\` to manage things like spaces in a directory name then you can see how it gets pretty confusing and complicated pretty quickly when you start to program... But in Python we can cope with _both_ of these situations and others using the `os` library (short for 'operating system'); see the examples below!\n",
