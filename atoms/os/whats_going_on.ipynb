As we learn to program, the world will seem a bit less friendly (maybe a *lot* less friendly) in the short term, but if you keep at it you will gain the ability to work much more quickly and powerfully with the computer through code. At it's most basic, a computer is a programmable device for performing calculations.\n",

    "The really important thing to get from this last video is that computers are chaining together long sets of simple operations which always basically work out to 1 or 0, which is the same as True or False. This is [Boolean logic](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/boolean.htm) and it is integral to computation _and_ to data processing, but you should always keep in mind that a huge set of calculations are going on in your computer in an order specified by a set of _rules_: do 'A', then do 'B', then... When these rules become sufficiently complex (they become like long recipes!) they are called algorithms. And when they get so complicated that they are not easy to write down as a set of logical outputs, it's often easier to express in a more human-readable form... which is why we have [programming languages](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/proglang.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember: finding the average of a set of numbers involves an algorithm (which, in a digital comupter, is based on lots of logical operations involving 1s and 0s). And calculating the probability that the lecturer won't show up to the first lecture also involves an algorithm, it's just that it's a much more complicated one unless you take matters into your own hands and arrange for an accident..."
