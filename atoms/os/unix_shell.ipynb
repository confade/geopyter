At that point, for anyone who learned to use a computer after about 1992, computers can seem very unfriendly indeed!

    "3. I then changed directory (using `cd`) into the directory called `KCL Modules` (and note that, because there's a space in the directory name I had to write this as `KCL\\ Modules`... that's because the Terminal couldn't otherwise tell if we meant to move to a directory called `KCL` and then run a command called `Modules`; it's a long story).\n",

    "* Once that's done you should type all of the above (or copy+paste) on to _one new line_ and you should see the first line of this file (http://bit.ly/2iIK9bA) printed to the Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command might seem _really_ cryptic but we can break this problem down into steps (as I did when trying to remember how to do it!):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `curl` -- this is a tool (hopefully installed on your computer!) that allows you to download a file from the internet using only the Terminal.\n",
    "2. `head` -- this utility works with the _top_ part of a file (`tail` starts working with the _end_ of a file)\n",
    "3. We 'glue' the output of `curl` together with `head` using `|` (known as a 'pipe') -- this tells the computer to pass the output of `curl` to the input of `head` (so head sees this as a file).\n",
    "4. `head -1` means 'take only the _first_ line of the file (so `head -10` would take the first _ten_ lines of the file).\n",
    "5. We then direct the output of `head` to a file called `Header.csv` using the redirection command `>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this one line of _code_ allows you to download a file, extract the first line of the file (so that we can see what the variables are!), and then write it to a file on the local computer. Assuming that you didn't see any errors, you should now have a file called `Header.csv` and can see this for yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of this is that we are gaining in power at the cost of 'ease of use'. Doing this same task _without_ using code would require: navigating to the web page, clicking the link to download the file, opening the file in a text editor or Excel, selecting and copying the first line, and then opening a new file, pasting in the copied data, and saving the file with a name and location!

A well-designed programming language like Python can make it a little bit _easier_ to learn each step, but it still _**won't make it easy**_. \n",

    "\n",
    "Two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because you will need to think _logically_ and in an _organised_ way about how you manage data when you start doing data analysis: you will almost never receive raw data that doesn't require some work; so if you save your raw data and your processed data in the same directory how can you be sure you've loaded the right file? It's much easier to have two folders -- `raw` or `source`, and `clean` or `output` -- and use Python to read in raw data from one directory and then write the processed data out to a different directory than it would be using Excel's `File > Save As`. That's because the path is just _text_ and you can easily work with it that way!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because once you've learned how to use the path on your _own_ computer, you can use the _same_ techniques to navigate a web server or computer on the other side of the planet using URLs (which are just paths with some special 'sauce' that tell Python that the file isn't on _your_ computer).\n",

    "\n",
    "In terms of terminology: any path that starts with a `/` is an _**absolute path**_ because we are starting from the _**root**_ directory; any path that starts with either `..` or `.` is a _**relative path**_ because it is starting from the _**current**_ directory and is relative to where the Terminal or program 'is' now.\n",
